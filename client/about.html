        <p>Your letter score will be on your letter tile.<br>
            You will have 7 letter tiles on your tile rack in order to play.<br>
            You will be able to change the board designs to play on different boards.<br>
            After each round the tile rack will be filled up to maximum of 7 letter tiles.<br>

            <br>
            Your score will be shown on the top right hand corner of the web page.<br>
            There is a information box which will present you with any relevant warnings or messages.<br>
            You can also be awarded special tile points which can be seen on the scrabble board. 
            This will double or tripple the letters you play or the words you form.<br>
